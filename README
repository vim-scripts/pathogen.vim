Manage your 'runtimepath' with ease.  In practical terms, pathogen.vim makes it super easy to install plugins and runtime files in their own private directories.

Add this to your vimrc:

    execute pathogen#infect()

Now any plugins you wish to install can be extracted to a subdirectory under ~/.vim/bundle, and they will be added to the 'runtimepath'.

Use :Helptags to run :helptags on every doc/ directory in your 'runtimepath'.
